# dupe-deleter
To clean current and all sub-directories of duplicate images - they are moved to a backup folder. 

Really quick and dirty, can perhaps be useful for someone looking into doing something similar. I'm for instance only using the file ending for checking if the file is an image, using something more proper that looks into the metadata of the file would likely yield better results. If you are planning on running this on your computer, make sure to try it out first - whatever happens is your own responsibilty. You will need to uncomment a single line there to actually perform the file moving.
